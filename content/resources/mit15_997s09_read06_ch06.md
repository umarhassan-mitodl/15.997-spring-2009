description: Lecture notes on measuring risk, dynamic models, the random walk model
  of stock prices, discrete time stochastic process, Monte Carlo simulation, the normal
  distribution of returns, the log-normal distribution of prices, probability calculations,
  estimating the parameters, the continuous time representation, the binomial and
  other tree or lattice representations, complications, from factor risk to project
  risk, and application of the random walk to other variables.
