  "course_description": "This is a course in how corporations make use of the insights and tools of risk management.

This course is taught from the point of view of the manufacturing corporation, the utility, the software firm\u2014any potential end-user of derivatives, but not the dealer. Most related courses focus on the extensive taxonomy of instruments and the complex models developed to price them, and on ways to exploit mispricing. While this course will make use of some of these pricing models, the focus is on how corporations use the insights and models to improve their operations, to increase the value of their real assets, or to create the financial flexibility necessary to implement their core strategy.\n",
